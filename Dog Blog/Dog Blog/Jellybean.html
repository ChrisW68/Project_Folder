      	<p>My first introduction in dog ownership was my brothers first dog named Pete!</p>
      	<p>I was in college at the time, my older brother decided to get a dog.  He found a cute little mutt at the local Humane Society and named her Pete.  She weighted around 25-30 lbs and was a total magnet to any person that had a heart.</p>
      	<p>One day he asked me to dog sit for the weekend while he and his wife travelled back home to visit family.  I never been around dogs a lot up to that point, but Pete was family and gave me a chance to get away from the dormitary for the weekend. The best memory I had that weekend was walking Pete down the block and running into a father and daughter walking the opposite direction.  The little girl was around 4-years old, she pulled her dad by the hand to me and asked with a smile could she pet my dog.  I told her that she needs to ask Pete.  She then approached Pete to ask permission to pet her and of course Pete obliged and walked up beside her to be petted.  The little girl started to pat Pete on the back hard, like little kids do, and Pete just smiled ear to ear.  I got on my knees and showed her how Pete likes to be be petted with gentle strokes down her.  The little girl and Pete loved the petting.  After about 5 minutes her and her father continued on their walk with a smile.</p>
      <p>After that interaction, I was sold.  I wanted a dog because they are awesome and make people smile.  Especially, little kids that just to give lovin to furry thing their own size.
