                    <div class="panel-collapse collapse">
                        <p >A programming boot camp, also commonly called a “developer boot camp” or “coding boot camp”, is an intensive training program in software development. A code school is an entity that delivers a dev boot camp.</p>
                <p>Jack Stanley and Erik Gross, the Co-Founders of The Tech Academy actually wrote an article that covers this subject. The article can be found here: <a href="http://blog.learncodinganywhere.com/post/what-is-a-code-school" target="_blank">http://blog.learncodinganywhere.com/post/what-is-a-code-school</a></p

                    <h3>There are so many coding boot camp programs out there, how do I choose one school to attend?</h3>					<div class="panel loading">
                    <p>This ultimately depends on what your end goal is. To fully answer this question, Jack Stanley and Erik Gross (the Co-Founders of The Tech Academy) wrote an article entitled "Which Code School is the Best?". This article can be found here: <a href="http://blog.learncodinganywhere.com/post/which-code-school-is-the-best" target="_blank">http://blog.learncodinganywhere.com/post/which-code-school-is-the-best</a></p>

                <p>Both of the above articles provide advice on how to approach one's search for the right program.</p>

                    <h3>How long has The Tech Academy been around?</h3>
                    <div class="panel loading">
                    	 <p>The short answer: since 2012.</p>
                <p>Erik (Co-Founder of The Tech Academy) has been training developers for over ten years. In 2012, he decided to launch his own programming boot camp under the name "Prosper I.T. Academy". The program has been running since then.</p>
                <p>At the end of 2013, Erik brought on Jack Stanley. They spent months on curriculum development and in early 2014, re-branded as The Tech Academy because based on suryeys done, The Tech Academy was a better name.</p>

                    <h3>When can I enroll?</h3>
                    <div class="panel loading">
                        <p>Anytime. We don’t have set class dates like “must enroll by June 12th" or anything of the sort. We allow students to start our program at a time/date that is best for them.</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>What is the schedule of the program?</h3>
                    <div class="panel loading">
                    	<p>Our program is self-paced. We are open weekdays, weeknights and weekends. We recommend students study a minimum of 40 hours a week at our school because this best guarantees they will complete their training within the normal time period. But, 40 hours a week is not required. We are flexible. Some students work full-time concurrently to taking our program, so they work on our program part-time; maybe 20 hours a week. We work with students so that they can study on a schedule that is most convenient for them.</p>

                    <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
                    <div class="panel loading">
                        <p>We currently are offering a discount on the Software Developer Boot Camp - the price is $7,980. This discount lasts until March 31, 2016, at which point our pricing will be reevaluated and most likely increased. The full price for the Software Developer Boot Camp is $10,000. </p>
                    <p>In short, if a student pays their tuition in full by March 31, the Software Developer Boot Camp costs $7,980.</p>
				<p class="scholarship">In addition to our discounted tuition price, we are also offering a $1000 scholarship for any student that can commit to studying at least 40 hours per week. In effect, the new tuition price would be brought down to $6,980 This scholarship should be taken advantage of quickly as there are a limited number offered.</p>

                    	<p>In short, yes.</p>
                <p>We are able to deliver our entire program remotely. The full Software Developer Boot Camp is available online and can be accessed from anywhere in the world.
A majority of our student body takes the program from home, with Instructors in Portland available during work hours to help.</p>
                <p>Student who live in Oregon attend the boot camp in at or Portland campus, in person.</p>
                <p>If a student has a choice between taking the program remotely (from home) or coming into the campus to take the program in person, we recommend the latter (coming to the school to student in person).</p>

                    	<p>For the Software Developer Boot Camp, the full price is $10,000. However, if a student pays the full tuition up front before March 31, we give a $2,020 discount - bringing the price to $7,980. We offer group discounts for companies who pay for training multiple employees at once through our school. </p>

                    	<p>Yes, our program is available in full online. Our Instructors are available over the phone, email, Skype, etc. to assist students through course by

                    	<p>Our program is a balance of theory study and practical experience. Throughout the Boot Camp, you will be assigned paired coding projects
occasionally. So the answer is: yes, sometimes you will be paired and sometimes you will work solo - just like the real world.</p>

                    <div class="panel loading">
                    	<p>1. There are Job Placement Directors at The Tech Academy whose sole job is to assist students and graduates in their job search.<br />
                    2. The final course of the Software Developer Boot Camp is the Job Placement Course. This course teaches people all they need to know to get
a job in technology.</p>
                <p>We work hard to ensure that every graduate lands a job.</p>
                <p>At the end of the day, we can't get a job for students, so the 100% placement rate is really the product of persistence on the part of students and
graduates of our program.</p>
