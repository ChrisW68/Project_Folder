The purpose of this Login form is to create programs to gain more experience and understanding of PHP/MySQL/and Javascript.  
When it is finished, I will have a admin form for login, a general form for login.  

The reason for this is because later I want to integrate as much as these forms as possible to for a larger project.  
Which will consist of sending a monthly house hold bills split, by email.  Because throughout the month when the bills
come in I want to record it in a database as I make the payment online through my bank and at the end of the month, when 
all the bills come in, I simply press the button and send a itemize bills due to my girlfriend.
