Portfolio Webpage for Chris Wiseman.

I enjoy problem solving and express my creativity in different programming languages.  

This Portfolio folder contains several programming languages and scripts that I used for creating some animations and functionality
that I wanted to play with.

Some of the Languages and script used:
-HTML and CSS for creating the standard look of the webpage
-BootStrap for creating the dynamic webpage and adding Modals to allow description for each Development Skills.
-PHP break out some of the HTML code to allow for easy and quick editing of webpage.

I hope you like it and would enjoy to hear feedback on what you think!
