      <h1>A little history about me and what made me into who you see now!</h1></center>
  </header>
	
  <p class="col-md" align="center">Since I was a kid, I was always curious how things worked and how to make things better.  My parents always taught me to ask "Why, and could it be better?</br>
  </p>
  <p class="col-md" align="center">                          My dad was a drafting teacher, carpenter during summer break and at a early age, got me curious in engineering.  He used to do contract work developing section/cut-away drawings for GE jet engines and from my earliest memories I was amazed at how he could think in such a way of visualizing what the part would look like.  My dad saw something in me where I was interested in the details on how things worked.  As I grew up, my parents (especially my dad) instilled in me that if I want to be a engineering I must consider it from every viewpoint and all parts of the process is equally important. </br>
  </p>
		<p class="col-md" align="center">I started my career as a Manufacturing Engineer.  From the start of engineering I was pushing technology to the limits.  Asking machine builders for some extras or asking why it was not standard.  I loved getting my hands dirty and figuring out how things ticked, only allowed to understand the machine after it broke and needing to fix it quickly. I enjoy being challenged and finding solutions to problems.  During my years in engineering, I was always felt if there was an app or a program for this it would make my job and the people I work with easier and better.    I would create Access databases for coworkers to better track what was being produced and give unbiased views of the strengths and weaknesses of the process. </br>
                            </p>
		<p class="col-md" align="center">When not engineering or programing:</br>
							I enjoy working on my house (always making it just a little more energy efficient and adding unique touches).  Trying (I do mean TRYING) to grow something in my vegetable garden.  When I have time, I find new places to explore hiking/cross-country/canoeing/paddle boarding. </p>
