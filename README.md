Here is a collection of code that I have been working on.

Being a engineer, I enjoy finding solutions to problems.  I started out my professional life as a Mechanical/Manufacturing Engineer and have always had a nawing feeling that a program code would make my job easier.  I started developing databases in Access many years ago to relieve some of the boring stuff and allow me to gleen more knowledge from the data.

This repository contains solutions to some of challenges I created:

HTML & CSS:
•Built a login page using HTML and CSS</br>
<a href="https://github.com/ChrisW68/Project_Folder/tree/master/Portfolio">•Built a Portfolio website using HTML and CSS</a>

BOOTSTRAP:
<a href="https://github.com/ChrisW68/Tribute_Page">•Built a small tribute page using BootStrap, HTML, and CSS</a>

JavaScript:
Build script for Live Project.

Python:
Built a SQLite database.

PHP:

<a href="https://github.com/ChrisW68/Project_Folder/tree/master/PHP%20programs">•Email submit program that allows emails from the webpage be sent with message to predesignated email address</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ChrisW68/Project_Folder/tree/master/PHP%20MySQL%20and%20JavaScript">•Building a login page with administration level and user label.  I am developing this into another project that will allow me to store all my monthly bills and send them to someone as a email, dividing the bills before sending.  This application will also allow me to see a historical record of the electric bill and gas bill to see if any improvement on the house is making any dent to the bills.


NodeJS:
Built a small website.

AngularJS:
<a href="https://github.com/ChrisW68/Project_Folder/tree/master/AngularJS">•Built two applications: one to calculate efficiency between light bulbs, the second as a messenger</a>
