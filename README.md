Here is a collection of code that I have been working on.

Being a engineer, I enjoy finding solutions to problems.  I started out my professional life as a Mechanical/Manufacturing Engineer and have always had a nawing feeling that a program code would make my job easier.  I started developing databases in Access many years ago to relieve some of the boring stuff and allow me to gleen more knowledge from the data.
