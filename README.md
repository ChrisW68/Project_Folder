Here is a collection of code that I have been working on.

Being a engineer, I enjoy finding solutions to problems.  I started out my professional life as a Mechanical/Manufacturing Engineer and have always had a nawing feeling that a program code would make my job easier.  I started developing databases in Access many years ago to relieve some of the boring stuff and allow me to gleen more knowledge from the data.

This repository contains solutions to some of challenges I created:

HTML & CSS:
Built a login page using HTML and CSS
Built a Portfolio webstie using HTML and CSS

JavaScript:

Python:
Built a SQLite database.

NodeJS:
Built a small website.

AngularJS:
Built a application to calculate efficiency and cost of different light bulb type and wattage for comparison.
Built a application for messaging.
