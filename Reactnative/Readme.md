<h1><strong>React Native Projects</strong></h1>

<h3>These projects were developed to give me a understanding of React Native, Redux, and become familiar with Android Studio.  The three projects were increasingly more difficult and allowed me to build apound each other. It is always fun for me when I learn something knew and have the "Ah Ha" moment when developing programs.  It is like I am a kid again!</h3>
